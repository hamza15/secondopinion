<h1>Second Opinion</h1>

<p>This Sinatra application is based on a "Yelp" based model. At it's core, it serves as a web application where Users can sign up, find local Doctors and write reviews for them. As listed above it uses three models:

- Users 
- Reviews
- Doctors

The idea is to implement an MVC design and allow for CRUD actions. Sinatra works with ActiveRecord as an ORM to communicate with SQLITE where data is persisted. All passwords and encrypted using bcrypt gem.
